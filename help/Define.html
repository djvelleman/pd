<H1>Define Command</H1>
<P>Sometimes in a proof it is useful to introduce a new variable to stand 
for some object that you want to talk about.  To do this, select the gap
in which you want to introduce the new variable (or select
any given or goal in that gap) and 
give the Define command.  A dialog box will open, asking you to fill in the 
blanks in the statement &#8220;Let ___ = ___&#8221;.  Fill in the first 
blank with the new variable you want to introduce, and fill in the second 
blank with an expression naming the object you want the new variable to 
stand for.  The variable you put in the first blank must not already be in 
use in the proof to stand for something else.
</P>
<P>This command is especially useful when your goal has the form 
&ldquo;<span class="formula"><i>x</i>=?</span>&rdquo;.  If you select a goal of this form and 
give the Define command, then the first blank will already be filled in 
with the variable that needs to be defined (although you can change it to a 
different one if you want to).  Defining this variable will achieve the 
goal, so if you define this variable then the gap will disappear and be 
replaced by the definition of the variable.  Double clicking on a goal of 
the form &ldquo;<span class="formula"><i>x</i>=?</span>&rdquo; is a shortcut for selecting the 
goal and giving the Define command.
