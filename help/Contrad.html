<H1>Contradiction Command</H1>
<P>Use the Contradiction command if you want to do 
a proof by contradiction.  Select the goal that you want to prove by 
contradiction and give the Contradiction command.  Proof Designer will 
create a subproof in which it is assumed that the goal is false, and then 
it will say that you must prove a contradiction to complete the subproof.  
The negation of the original goal will be added to the givens list, and 
the new goal will be listed as &#8220;Contradiction&#8221;.
</P>
<P>If you are working on a proof by contradiction and you think you know 
which given you want to contradict, you can select it and give the 
Contradiction command.  Proof Designer will indicate that you have to 
prove the negation of the selected given in order to arrive at the desired 
contradiction.
</P>
<P>You can combine these two uses of the Contradiction command in one 
step: If you want to do a proof by contradiction and you know right from 
the start which given you want to contradict, select the given and give 
the Contradiction command.  Proof Designer will create a subproof in which 
it is assumed that the goal is false, and then it will say that you must 
prove the negation of the selected given to arrive at a contradiction.
