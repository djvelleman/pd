<H1>Reflexive Law Command</H1>
<P>The reflexive law for equality says that for any object <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>, 
<span class="formula"><i>x</i>=<i>x</i></span>.  To use this law, select the gap in which you want to 
apply the reflexive law (or the goal of the gap) and 
give the Reflexive Law command.  A dialog box will open asking what object 
you want to use for <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> in the reflexive law.  Enter an expression 
naming some object and click OK, and Proof Designer will assert that the 
object is equal to itself.
</P>
<p>If your goal has the form <span class="formula"><i>x</i>=<i>x</i></span>, for some
object <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>, then you can select the goal and give the
Reflexive Law command, and Proof Designer will infer the goal without opening a
dialog box.
