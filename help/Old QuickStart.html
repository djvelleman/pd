<H1>Quick Start</H1>
<P>Perhaps the best way to see what Proof Designer does is to work out a
simple example.  These instructions will lead you through using Proof
Designer to prove the following theorem: If <span class="formula"><i>F</i>&sube;<i>G</i></span>
then <span class="formula">&cup;<i>F</i>&sube;&cup;<i>G</i></span>.
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Choose &ldquo;New Theorem&rdquo; from the Edit menu in the Proof Designer window.
A dialog box will open, asking you to type in the hypotheses and conclusion
of the theorem you want to prove.  Type <span class="formula"><i>F</i>&sube;<i>G</i></span>
and click the Add Hypothesis button.  (To type the
subset symbol, <span class="formula">&sube;</span>, type alt-S (Windows)
or option-S (Macintosh), or click the mouse on the <span class="formula">&sube;</span>
button in the symbol palette at the top of the dialog box.) 
If you have made a typographical error and the statement you have typed
doesn't make sense, you will get an error message at this point.  Fix the
error and try again.  If you typed it correctly, the statement
<span class="formula"><i>F</i>&sube;<i>G</i></span> will appear in the list of
hypotheses.  Now type <span class="formula">&cup;<i>F</i>&sube;&cup;<i>G</i></span>
and click on the Set Conclusion button.  (To type the union symbol,
<span class="formula">&cup;</span>, type alt-shift-U (Windows) or
option-shift-U (Macintosh), or use the symbol palette.)  If you have
entered the hypothesis incorrectly, you can click on it to select it, click
the Cut Hypothesis button, and then enter the hypothesis correctly.  If you
have entered the conclusion incorrectly, just enter the correct one and
click the Set Conclusion button again; the new conclusion will replace the
old one.  When you have the hypothesis and conclusion entered correctly,
click OK. The statement of the theorem will appear in the Proof Designer window, followed by
the word &#8220;Proof:&#8221; and then a summary of what you know
(&#8220;Given&#8221;) and what you have to prove (&#8220;Goal&#8221;) in
order to complete the proof.  This summary is set off from the rest of the
contents of the window by being indented and enclosed in a box, and in the
upper left corner of the box there is a small button containing a
&#8220;?&#8221;.  (We'll see what the button does later.)  As you follow
the instructions below, an outline of the proof will gradually take shape
in this window.  &#8220;Gaps&#8221; in the proof indicating where
additional steps still need to be added will always be indicated in this
outline by summaries like this one, contained in boxes with a ?  button in
the upper left corner.
</LI>
<LI>Click on the statement <span class="formula">&cup;<i>F</i>&sube;&cup;<i>G</i></span>
under the heading &#8220;Goal&#8221;.  It will get highlighted to indicate
that it has been selected.  Now choose the Reexpress command from the
Strategy menu.  A dialog box will appear displaying the statement you
selected, with buttons allowing you to reexpress the statement in a number
of ways.  Click on the Apply Definition button, and the statement will get
reexpressed as
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>F</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>G</i>)</span>
(applying the definition of <span class="formula">&sube;</span>, of
course).  Click OK. The statement
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>F</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>G</i>)</span>
will be listed as a
<EM>variant</EM> of the original goal
<span class="formula">&cup;<i>F</i>&sube;&cup;<i>G</i></span>.  It is equivalent to the original
goal, so proving the statement in either form would suffice to complete the
proof.  A variant of a given or goal is always listed below it, indented,
with an open circle in front of it rather than a bullet.
</LI>
<LI>Since the new variant of the goal starts with <span class="formula">&forall;<i>a</i></span>,
  the best way to proceed is to let <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> stand
for an arbitrary object.  Click on the new variant of the goal to select
it, and choose the Arbitrary Object command from the Goal menu.  A
dialog box will appear, asking what name you would like to use for the
arbitrary object.  The default choice <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> will already be filled in,
but if you want to use a different name you can just type it in.  Click OK.
The window containing the proof will get updated.  Proof Designer will
create a subproof in which <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> is introduced as an arbitrary object. 
To finish the subproof, you must prove the statement
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>F</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>G</i></span>. 
The declaration of <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> as an arbitrary object only applies to steps
inside the subproof; outside the subproof, <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> is undefined.  To
indicate this, Proof Designer sets off the subproof from the rest of the
proof by indenting it and enclosing it in a box.  In the upper left corner
of the box there is a small button containing the symbol &#8220;&therefore;&#8221;.  Proof Designer also writes the final
sentence of the proof, saying that since <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> was arbitrary, we can
conclude that <span class="formula">&cup;<i>F</i>&sube;&cup;<i>G</i></span>.
</LI>
<LI>The goal is now an if-then statement.  You can prove it either by doing
a direct proof, or by proving the contrapositive.  In this case a direct
proof is probably easiest, so select the goal and choose Direct from the
Goal menu.  Proof Designer will introduce another subproof, nested
inside the first, in which it is assumed that
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>F</i></span>, and you must
prove that <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>G</i></span>.
This subproof justifies the conclusion that
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>F</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>G</i></span>. 
The subproof is set off from the rest of the proof to indicate that the
assumption <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>F</i></span>
only applies within the subproof.
</LI>
<LI>Click on the goal <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>G</i></span> and choose Reexpress from the
Strategy menu.  (Shortcut: double-clicking on a statement is equivalent to
selecting it and choosing the Reexpress command.)  Click the Apply
Definition button again, and the statement will get rewritten as
<span class="formula">&exist;<i>b</i>&isin;<i>G</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>b</i>)</span>. 
Click OK.
</LI>
<LI>Since the goal starts with <span class="formula">&exist;<i>b</i></span>,
we must find a value to plug in for <span class="formula"><i>b</i></span>.  To do this we will have to
look more closely at the givens.  The best one to start with is
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>F</i></span>, since it will also start with
<span class="formula">&exist;</span> when the definition of <span class="formula">&cup;</span>
is written out, and it is always best to use a given that starts with
<span class="formula">&exist;</span> immediately.  So select the given
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&cup;<i>F</i></span> and use the
Apply Definition button in the Reexpress
dialog box to rewrite it as <span class="formula">&exist;<i>b</i>&isin;<i>F</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>b</i>)</span>.
</LI>
<LI>When you know something exists, you should always give it a name.  So
select the new given variant
<span class="formula">&exist;<i>b</i>&isin;<i>F</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>b</i>)</span>
and choose Existential Instantiation from the Infer
menu.  A dialog box will appear, asking what name you want to give to the
object that exists.  It might be best to use something other than <span class="formula"><i>b</i></span>,
to avoid confusion with the other uses of the letter <span class="formula"><i>b</i></span> in the proof,
so let's use <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span>.  Enter <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span>
in the dialog box, and then click
the OK button.  The statements <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i></span>
and <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>F</i></span> will get added to the givens list.
</LI>
<LI>Notice that every time you do a step, a little bit gets added to the
proof.  This might be a good time to look at what's been written so far. 
If you click on the ?  button, the givens and goal list will be hidden, and
you can see more clearly how the proof is shaping up.  Click on the ? 
button again to show the givens and goal again.  Similarly, the &therefore;
buttons hide or show the details of the
subproofs they introduce.  Try them out!
</LI>
<LI>We can now say what value should be plugged in for <span class="formula"><i>b</i></span> to prove
the goal.  Looking at the givens, you should see that the right choice is
<span class="formula"><i>b</i>=<i>X</i></span>.  So select the goal variant
<span class="formula">&exist;<i>b</i>&isin;<i>G</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>b</i>)</span>
and choose Existence from the Goal menu.  A dialog box will appear,
asking you what value should be plugged in for <span class="formula"><i>b</i></span> to make the goal
true.  Choose the "Use this value" option (it should already be selected),
type in <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span>, and click the OK button.  The proof will get updated. 
There are now <EM>two</EM> gaps in the proof, because you have to prove two
statements to complete the proof.  In the first gap, your goal is to prove
<span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>G</i></span>, and in the second, you
must prove <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i></span>.  You can
work on the gaps in either order.
</LI>
<LI>Fortunately, we already know <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i></span>,
so let's deal with the second gap first.  The goal
of this gap is already among the givens, so there is nothing more to prove,
but Proof Designer does not recognize this automatically.  You must tell
Proof Designer that the goal has been achieved.  To do this, select the
given <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i></span> in the second gap
and give the Finish command from the Edit menu.  The second gap will
disappear.
</LI>
<LI>We will have to do a few more steps to prove the goal of the other
gap, <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>G</i></span>.  Of course, it
will follow from the givens <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>F</i></span>
and <span class="formula"><i>F</i>&sube;<i>G</i></span>.  Click on the given
<span class="formula"><i>F</i>&sube;<i>G</i></span> and use the Apply Definition
button in the Reexpress dialog box to write it out as
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>b</i>(<i>b</i>&isin;<i>F</i>&rarr;<i>b</i>&isin;<i>G</i>)</span>.
</LI>
<LI>Select the new given variant
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>b</i>(<i>b</i>&isin;<i>F</i>&rarr;<i>b</i>&isin;<i>G</i>)</span>
and choose the Universal
Instantiation command in the Infer menu.  This command lets you plug in
anything you want for <span class="formula"><i>b</i></span> in the statement
<span class="formula"><i>b</i>&isin;<i>F</i>&rarr;<i>b</i>&isin;<i>G</i></span>.
A dialog box will appear, asking
what you would like to substitute for <span class="formula"><i>b</i></span>.
In this case you want to substitute <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span> for
<span class="formula"><i>b</i></span>, so choose the "Use this value" option (as
before, it should already be selected), type in <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span>, and click the OK
button.  The new given <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>F</i>&rarr;<i>X</i>&isin;<i>G</i></span>
will appear in the givens list.
</LI>
<LI>Click on the new given <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>F</i>&rarr;<i>X</i>&isin;<i>G</i></span>
to select it, and then <EM>shift</EM>-click (i.e., hold down the shift key on the keyboard while
clicking with the mouse) on the given <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>F</i></span>
to select it as well.  Choose Modus Ponens from the
Infer menu.  Proof Designer will draw the inference
<span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>G</i></span>.
</LI>
<LI>The proof is now complete, since the desired goal,
  <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>G</i></span>, was just inferred in
the last step.  Select the given <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&isin;<i>G</i></span>
and choose Finish from the Edit menu.  The last gap
in the proof will disappear, and Proof Designer will congratulate you on
finishing the proof.  Notice that the backgrounds of the buttons
introducing subproofs change from gray to white.  Subproof buttons always
change from gray to white when their subproofs are completed.
</LI>
<LI>If you want to print your proof, you can use your browser's Print command.
</LI>
</OL>
<P>You should now have a pretty good idea of what Proof Designer does.
