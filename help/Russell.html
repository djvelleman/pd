<H1>Russell's Paradox</H1>
<P>Suppose that &#8220;<span class="formula">&hellip;<i>x</i>&hellip;</span>&#8221; is some statement
about an unspecified object called <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>.  This statement will be true
for some values of <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> and false for others.  It is tempting to think
that we could form the set of all values of <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> for which the
statement is true.  In other words, it is tempting to think that the
expression
</P>
<P class="display"><span class="formula">{<i>x</i>|&hellip;<i>x</i>&hellip;}</span>
</P>
<P>should be accepted as a definition of a set.  However, the assumption
that such expressions always name sets leads to a contradiction.  This was
first noticed by Bertrand Russell in 1901, and so it has come to be known
as <EM>Russell's Paradox</EM>.
</P>
<P>To see how the paradox is derived, suppose that all expressions of the
type displayed above do name sets.  Russell suggested that we consider the
following definition of a set <span class="formula"><i>R</i></span>:
</P>
<P class="display"><span class="formula"><i>R</i>={<i>x</i>|<i>x</i>&notin;<i>x</i>}</span>
</P>
<P>According to this definition, an object <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> will be an element of
<span class="formula"><i>R</i></span> if and only if <span class="formula"><i>x</i>&notin;<i>x</i></span>.
But now suppose we ask whether or not <span class="formula"><i>R</i></span> is
an element of itself.  Plugging in <span class="formula"><i>R</i></span> for <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>
in the definition of <span class="formula"><i>R</i></span>, we come to the conclusion that
<span class="formula"><i>R</i>&isin;<i>R</i></span> if and only if
<span class="formula"><i>R</i>&notin;<i>R</i></span>.  But this is impossible; whether
<span class="formula"><i>R</i></span> is an element of itself or not, this statement cannot be true.
Thus we have
reached a contradiction.
</P>
<P>The lesson that most mathematicians have drawn from Russell's Paradox is
that definitions of the kind displayed above cannot always be trusted to
define sets.  To avoid the paradox, mathematicians use only a restricted
form of this kind of definition.  If <span class="formula"><i>U</i></span> is a set, then mathematicians
accept the following expression as a definition of a set:
</P>
<P class="display"><span class="formula">{<i>x</i>&isin;<i>U</i>|&hellip;<i>x</i>&hellip;}</span>
</P>
<P>In this definition, only elements of <span class="formula"><i>U</i></span> are considered for
membership in the set being defined.  Among elements of <span class="formula"><i>U</i></span>, only
those that make the statement &#8220;<span class="formula">&hellip;<i>x</i>&hellip;</span>&#8221; come out true
are elements of the set.  Following the usual practice in mathematics,
Proof Designer only allows definitions of this more restricted kind.
</P>
<P>Of course, if <span class="formula"><i>U</i></span> were a set that contained
absolutely everything, then this restricted definition would be equivalent
to the previous, unrestricted one, and would therefore be unacceptable. 
Thus, Russell's Paradox can be thought of as a proof that there can be no
set that contains absolutely everything.  In fact, this makes a nice,
challenging exercise in Proof Designer!  See if you can use Proof Designer
to prove, from no hyptheses, the conclusion
<span class="formula">&not;&exist;<i>U</i>&forall;<i>x</i>(<i>x</i>&isin;<i>U</i>)</span>.
</P>
<P>Russell's Paradox also explains why Proof Designer places a restriction
on intersections of families of sets.  If <span class="formula"><i>F</i></span> is a set whose elements
are sets, the <span class="formula">&cap;<i>F</i></span> is the intersection
of all of the sets in <span class="formula"><i>F</i></span>.  Thus, for any <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>,
<span class="formula"><i>x</i>&isin;&cap;<i>F</i></span> if
and only if <span class="formula">&forall;<i>A</i>&isin;<i>F</i>(<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>)</span>. 
But if <span class="formula"><i>F</i>=&empty;</span> then the statement
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>A</i>&isin;<i>F</i>(<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>)</span>
would be true no matter what <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> is, and therefore
<span class="formula">&cap;<i>F</i></span> would be a set containing everything.  Since
Russell's Paradox shows that there can be no such set, it follows that
<span class="formula">&cap;&empty;</span> is not a
set.  For this reason, Proof Designer requires that you explicitly include
at least one set in any intersection.  If <span class="formula"><i>U</i></span> is
a set and <span class="formula"><i>F</i></span> is
a family of sets, then <span class="formula"><i>U</i>&cap;&cap;<i>F</i></span> is the
intersection of <span class="formula"><i>U</i></span> and
all of the elements of <span class="formula"><i>F</i></span>.  In other words,
</P>
<P class="display"><span class="formula"><i>U</i>&cap;&cap;<i>F</i>={<i>x</i>&isin;<i>U</i>|&forall;<i>A</i>&isin;<i>F</i>(<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>)}</span>.
</P>
<P>Since the values of <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> in this definition must come from the set
  <span class="formula"><i>U</i></span>, this definition is acceptable.
