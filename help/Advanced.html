<H1>Advanced Features of Proof Designer</H1>
<P>The instructions below will lead you through a proof that
<span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&sube;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)&rarr;<i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>.
This proof will illustrate some of the more advanced features of Proof 
Designer.
</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<p>Choose New Theorem from the File menu.  
In the dialog box, type
<span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&sube;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)&rarr;<i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>.
and click the Set Conclusion button.
There are no hypotheses for this theorem.  Click OK.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Select the goal
  <span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&sube;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)&rarr;<i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>
and choose Direct from the Goal menu.  Proof Designer will suppose that
<span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&sube;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span>
 and it will say that you must 
now prove that <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>.
  </p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Select the given <span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&sube;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span> and choose
Reexpress from the Strategy menu.  Click on the Apply Definition button, 
but <EM>don't</EM> click on OK yet.  Proof Designer will rewrite the statement 
as <span class="formula">&forall;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>))</span>.
Now use the mouse to select the statement
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)</span>, 
which appears before the <span class="formula">&rarr;</span>.  (You do this 
just the way you would do it in a word processing program, by dragging the
mouse across what you want 
to select.)  Click Apply Definition again and Proof Designer will change
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)</span>
to <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>, writing out the 
definition of power set.  Use the same procedure to write out
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span> as
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>, and then click 
OK.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Select the given variant 
  <span class="formula">&forall;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&sube;<i>A</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&sube;<i>B</i>)</span> and 
choose Universal Instantiation from the Infer menu.  When the dialog box 
appears, say that you want to substitute <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> for
<span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>.  
Proof Designer will infer 
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i>&rarr;<i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>.
  </p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Select the given <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i>&rarr;<i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span> 
and the goal <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span> and choose 
Modus Ponens from the Infer menu.  Proof Designer will use the modus 
ponens 
inference rule to work backwards from the goal.  Proof Designer will say 
that you can infer the goal <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>
by modus ponens from
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i>&rarr;<i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span> and
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>, but you must still 
prove <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>.
  </p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Although you could just fill in the proof of
  <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>
where Proof Designer says it is needed, it might be better to indicate 
somehow that this is a general fact about all sets, and not a fact about 
this specific set <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span>.  To do this, click on the sentence 
&#8220;Suppose
<span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&sube;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span>&#8221; at the 
beginning of the 
proof.  This selects the entire subproof that is introduced by this 
sentence, along with the conclusion it justifies.  (You can also do this 
by clicking in the margin to the left of this subproof, or on the 
conclusion it justifies.)  Choose Insert from the Edit menu.  This will 
allow you to insert some new steps before the subproof you have just 
selected.  A dialog box will appear, asking what goal you want to achieve 
with these additional steps.  Click on the choice saying that you want to 
prove something, and type in
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>(<i>x</i>&sube;<i>x</i>)</span> as 
the statement you want to prove.  Click OK.
</p>
<p>Proof Designer will insert a new gap in the proof 
whose goal is to prove that <span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>(<i>x</i>&sube;<i>x</i>)</span>.  
Note that in the original gap, where you still need to prove that
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>, the statement
  <span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>(<i>x</i>&sube;<i>x</i>)</span>
is now listed as a given.
</LI>
</p>
<LI>
  <p>It would look better to have the proof of the statement
  <span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>(<i>x</i>&sube;<i>x</i>)</span>
  set off from the rest of the proof 
as a lemma.  (A lemma is a small theorem that is used to prove another 
theorem.)  To do this, click on the sentence &#8220;Proof of
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>(<i>x</i>&sube;<i>x</i>)</span>
goes here&#8221; at the beginning 
of the new proof gap.  This selects the entire gap.  (You can also do this 
by clicking in the margin to the left of the gap.)  Now choose Lemma from 
the Edit menu.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>You now have two gaps to complete.  You can do them in either order.  
To prove the lemma, you can let <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> be arbitrary, reexpress
<span class="formula"><i>x</i>&sube;<i>x</i></span> as 
  <span class="formula">&forall;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>x</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;<i>x</i>)</span>,
let <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> be arbitrary, and then do a direct proof of
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;<i>x</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;<i>x</i></span>.  Note 
that after 
you give the Direct command, your goal will already be listed as a given, 
so you can select the given and give the Finish command.  To fill in the 
second gap, you can apply universal instantiation to the given
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>(<i>x</i>&sube;<i>x</i>)</span> to conclude that 
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Let's try changing the proof.  Click on the final conclusion
&#8220;Therefore 
<span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&sube;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)&rarr;<i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>,&#8221;
which selects this conclusion and the subproof that justifies it.  Choose 
Rejustify from the Edit menu.  The subproof and conclusion will disappear, 
and be replaced by a gap that says &#8220;Proof of
<span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&sube;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)&rarr;<i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>
goes here.&#8221;  We can now redo the proof a different way.  (Leave the 
lemma there&#8212;we'll need it in this version of the proof too.  If you 
want, you can hide the details of its proof.)
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Select the goal
    <span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&sube;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)&rarr;<i>A</i>&sube;<i>B</i></span>
and choose Contrapositive from the Goal menu.  Proof Designer will
suppose that <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span>, and it 
will say that you must prove 
that <span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&#x2288&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span>.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Select the goal <span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&#x2288&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span>
  and choose 
Reexpress from the Strategy menu.  Click on Apply Definition, but 
<EM>don't</EM> click OK yet.  Proof Designer will reexpress the goal as
<span class="formula">&not;&forall;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>))</span>.
Now click Reexpress Negative and Proof Designer will change this to
<span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>&not;(<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>))</span>.
Note that now only
<span class="formula">&not;(<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>))</span>
is selected, so you can click Reexpress Negative again to change the 
statement to
<span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&and;<i>a</i>&notin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>))</span>.
Click OK.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>The goal has now been rewritten as the existential statement
    <span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&and;<i>a</i>&notin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>))</span>,
so you should probably try to prove it by finding an example of a set 
which is an 
element of <span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)</span> but not
<span class="formula">&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span>, but it may not be clear at 
first what set to use.  Here's how you can deal with this situation:  
Select the goal variant
<span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&and;<i>a</i>&notin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>))</span>
and choose Existence from the Goal menu.  A dialog box will appear, 
asking what 
value you want to substitute for <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> in the goal.  Click on the 
&#8220;Use this new variable, whose definition will be inserted 
later&#8221; option.  The default choice for the new variable is <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>, 
but if you 
want to use a different name you can just type it in.  Click OK.  You will 
now have 
two gaps in the proof, one labeled &#8220;Definition of <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> goes 
here,&#8221;
followed by one labeled &#8220;Proof of 
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&and;<i>a</i>&notin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span> 
goes here.&#8221;  As usual, you can work on these gaps in either order.  
In particular, even before defining <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> you can start in on the proof 
that <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&and;<i>a</i>&notin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span>.  When you 
get far enough in the proof that you can tell what <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> should be, you 
can go 
back and fill in the definition of <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Select the goal 
  <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)&and;<i>a</i>&notin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span>
  and give the
Reexpress command from the Strategy menu.  Select the statement 
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;&Pscr;(<i>A</i>)</span> and click Apply Definition to change this to
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>.  Select
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&notin;&Pscr;(<i>B</i>)</span> and click 
Apply Definition to change it to <span class="formula">&not;(<i>a</i>&sube;<i>B</i>)</span>.  You 
can click 
Reexpress Negative if you want to change this to <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span>.  Click OK.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Notice now that the goal is
  <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&sube;<i>A</i>&and;<i>a</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span>, and 
one of the givens is
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span>.  This suggests that 
perhaps you should have defined 
<span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> to be equal to <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span>.
Go back to the gap labeled 
&#8220;Definition of <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> goes here,&#8221; select the goal
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>=?</span>,
and choose Define from the 
Strategy menu.  A dialog box will appear, containing the statement 
&#8220;Let ___ = ___.&#8221;  The first blank will already be filled in 
with the 
default value <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>.  Fill in the second with
<span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> and click OK.  
The definition 
of <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> will be added to the proof, and the gap labeled 
&#8220;Definition of 
<span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> goes here&#8221; will disappear.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Select the goal variant
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&sube;<i>A</i>&and;<i>a</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span>
and choose Substitute from the Strategy menu.  A dialog box will appear.  In
the dialog box, click on the word &ldquo;Substitute&rdquo; and a menu will appear,
showing what substitutions you can apply.  Since we now know
that <span class="formula"><i>a</i>=<i>A</i></span>,  you can choose to 
substitute either <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span> for
<span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> or <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> for
<span class="formula"><i>A</i></span>.  Choose <span class="formula"><i>a</i>&rArr;<i>A</i></span>
from the menu, indicating that you want to 
replace <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> with <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span>,
and the substitution will be performed.  Click OK.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>The goal is now <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i>&and;<i>A</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span>, 
and you already have <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span>
in the given column.  Select the given
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span> and the goal
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i>&and;<i>A</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span>, and 
choose Conjunction from the Goal menu.  Proof Designer will say that you can infer
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i>&and;<i>A</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span> from 
<span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>
and <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&#x2288<i>B</i></span>, but you still 
have to prove <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Apply universal instantiation to 
  <span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>(<i>x</i>&sube;<i>x</i>)</span>
  to conclude that <span class="formula"><i>A</i>&sube;<i>A</i></span>.  
This is your goal, so you can now use the Finish command to complete the 
proof.
</p>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>Note that we introduced the variable <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> into this proof only 
because, 
at the time we introduced it, we didn't know it would turn out to be equal 
to <span class="formula"><i>A</i></span>.  Now that the proof is done, we could improve on it by 
eliminating all mention of <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>,  and only talking about
<span class="formula"><i>A</i></span>.
Often you will be able to improve on the proof outline written by Proof
Designer.  You should use Proof Designer to work out an outline of a
correct proof, and then try to improve on it when you write up the final proof.
