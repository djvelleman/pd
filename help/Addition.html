<H1>Addition Command</H1>
<P>From a given statement <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> you can infer
<span class="formula"><i>P</i>&or;<i>Q</i></span>, 
for any statement <span class="formula"><i>Q</i></span>.  Select any given
<span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> and give the 
Addition command, and a dialog box will open asking you to fill in the 
blank in the statement <span class="formula"><i>P</i>&or;___</span> in order
to specify what inference you want to make.
</P>
<P>You can also use this command to work backwards from your goal.  If you 
select a given <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> and goal
<span class="formula"><i>P</i>&or;<i>Q</i></span> and give the 
Addition command, Proof Designer will infer the goal from the given.
</P>
<P>Parentheses in your goal can affect how the Addition 
command works.  For example, if you select a given <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> and goal
<span class="formula"><i>P</i>&or;<i>Q</i>&or;<i>R</i></span>
and give the Addition command, then Proof Designer will infer the goal
from the given.  But if the goal is 
<span class="formula">(<i>P</i>&or;<i>Q</i>)&or;<i>R</i></span>,
then the command won't work, because Proof Designer won't consider the selected given
to be one of the disjuncts of the goal.  Thus, you 
may want to add or remove parentheses in your goal before using the 
Addition command.  To add or remove parentheses, use the
