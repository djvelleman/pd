<H1>Rejustify Command</H1>
<P>If you select a step in the proof and give the Rejustify command, then
the step and its justification will be deleted, and they will be replaced
by a gap whose goal is to prove the assertion.
</P>
<P>Note that if the step is justified by a subproof, you can use the
Rejustify command even if the subproof still has gaps in it.  For example,
suppose you are proving a statement of the form
<span class="formula"><i>P</i>&rarr;<i>Q</i></span>, and you begin by using the
<A href="Direct.html">Direct</A> command.  This would create a subproof in
which it is assumed that <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> is true, and you
must prove that <span class="formula"><i>Q</i></span>
is true.  The subproof would justify the assertion that
<span class="formula"><i>P</i>&rarr;<i>Q</i></span> is true.  While trying to prove
<span class="formula"><i>Q</i></span> in the subproof, you might run into trouble and
decide that you would have been better off proving
<span class="formula"><i>P</i>&rarr;<i>Q</i></span> by proving the contrapositive.
If so, click on the assertion <span class="formula"><i>P</i>&rarr;<i>Q</i></span>, which will
select the assertion and the subproof that justifies it, and give the
Rejustify command.  The assertion and subproof will disappear, and be
replaced by a gap whose goal is <span class="formula"><i>P</i>&rarr;<i>Q</i></span>.
Now you can select the goal and give the <A href="Contrapos.html">Contrapositive</A> command.
