<H1>Delete Command</H1>
<P>You can use the Delete command to delete a given, a variant of a given 
or goal, a gap in the proof, or a step in the proof.  Select whatever 
you want to delete and give the Delete command (or press the delete key on 
the keyboard), and if the deletion is allowed, it will be done.
</P>
<P>You can delete any given or any variant of a given or goal, and you can 
select several givens or variants and delete them all in one step.  This can 
be useful if your given list is getting long and you are sure that you 
won't need certain givens.  But you probably shouldn't delete givens 
unless you are sure that you won't need them.
</P>
<P>You cannot delete a gap or a step in the proof if it is needed later in 
the proof.  The last step in a proof or subproof is always needed, because 
it is what justifies the final conclusion of the proof, so you can never 
delete the last step in a proof.
