<H1>New Theorem Command</H1>
<P>To start proving a theorem, give the New Theorem command.
  A dialog box will open, asking you to enter the hypotheses and 
  conclusion of the theorem you want to prove.  To enter a hypothesis, type 
  it into the space labeled &#8220;Enter hypotheses and conclusion 
  here&#8221; and then click the Add Hypothesis button, and it will be added to 
  the list of hypotheses.  To enter the 
  conclusion, type it in and click the Set Conclusion button.  When typing 
  the hypotheses and conclusion, use ordinary set-theoretic and logical 
  notation.  (For a more complete explanation of how to type statements into 
  Proof Designer, click <A href="Expressions.html">here</A>.)  If you change 
  your mind about one of the hypotheses, you can click on it to select it and 
  then click the Cut Hypothesis button to remove it from the list.  If you 
  change your mind about the conclusion, just type in a different conclusion and 
  click the Set Conclusion button.  The new conclusion will replace the old 
  one.  When you have entered the hypotheses and conclusion, click OK.  The
  theorem will be entered into the Proof Designer window, and you can begin
  working on constructing the proof.
</P>
<p>Note that if you are in the middle of proving a theorem when you use the New Theorem command, the theorem you
  are working on will be discarded and replaced by the new theorem you enter.  So if you don't want to lose
  the proof you are working on, use the <a href="Save.html">Save</a> command to save it before using the New Theorem command.
