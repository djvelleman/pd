<H1>Existential Instantiation Command</H1>
<P>If you have a given of the form <span class="formula">&exist;<i>x</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>
or <span class="formula">&exist;!<i>x</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>,
then you can introduce a new variable into the proof to stand for a value (or the unique value) of 
<span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> for which <span class="formula"><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>
is true.  Select the given and give the Existential Instantiation command,
and a dialog box will open asking 
what variable you would like to use to stand for the object that is 
asserted to exist.  You must choose a variable that is not already in use 
in the proof to stand for something else.  When you click OK, Proof 
Designer will add a step to the proof asserting that <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> is true of 
the object named by the variable you chose (and, if appropriate, that it is the only such object).
</P>
<P>If the given starts with several existential quantifiers in a row, then you can 
introduce several new variables in one step.  Choose a variable to 
stand for the first object asserted to exist, and then click the Next button.  
Proof Designer will fill in the variable you selected and then ask what 
name you would like to use for the next object.  Once you have 
chosen a name for the last object you want to introduce, click 
OK.
</P>
<p>
If your goal is to define some variable <span class="formula"><i>y</i></span>, and
<span class="formula"><i>y</i></span> gets defined as a result of the Existential Instantiation
command, then Proof Designer will recognize that you have achieved your goal and remove the gap
from the proof.  As a shortcut for this, you can select both an existential given statement
<span class="formula">&exist;<i>x</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>
or <span class="formula">&exist;!<i>x</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span> and the goal
<span class="formula"><i>y</i>=?</span>
and give the Existential Instantiation command.  Proof Designer will use
<span class="formula"><i>y</i></span> as the name of the object asserted to exist.  Since this step
achieves the goal of defining <span class="formula"><i>y</i></span>, Proof Designer will remove
the gap from the proof.
