<P>
If you want to save the proof you are working on and come back to it later, use the Save command.  When
you give the Save command, a file named PDProof.txt will be downloaded to the default download location
on your computer.  (If there is already a file with that name, the file may be renamed something like
PDProof-2.txt or PDProof(2).txt.)  Later, you can use the <a href="Open.html">Open</a> command
to open the file and continue working on the proof.
</P>
<p>
The file Proof Designer saves is a plain text file.  You can open it in a word processing
programming if you want to see what's in it.  But don't edit it!  If you make any changes to the file, you
will probably get an error message when you open the file in Proof Designer.
