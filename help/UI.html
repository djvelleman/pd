<H1>Universal Instantiation Command</H1>
<P>If you have a given of the form <span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>, then 
you can infer that <span class="formula"><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span> is true for any value of
<span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>
that you choose.  Select the given and give the Universal Instantiation 
command, and a dialog box will open asking what value 
you would like to assign to <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>.  If you know what value you want to use for 
<span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>, type it into the &#8220;Use this value&#8221; box and click OK.  Proof 
Designer will infer that <span class="formula"><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span> is true for this 
value of <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>.
</P>
<P>If you don't know what 
value you want to use for <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>, you can use the &#8220;Use this new 
variable, whose definition will be inserted later&#8221; box.  A default
variable may be filled in already, but you can change it if 
you want to.  You must choose a variable that is not already in use in the 
proof to stand for something else.  If you choose this option, then Proof 
Designer will insert a new gap into the proof in which you must give a 
definition of the variable you chose, and then it will infer that <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> 
is true of the object named by that variable.  Thus, 
there will now be <EM>two</EM> gaps in the proof: one for the definition 
of the new variable, and one for the goal that you were originally 
working on proving.  You can work on these two gaps in either 
order.  In particular, you may find it useful to continue working on 
proving your goal until you reach the point where you know what value 
should be assigned to the variable, and then go back and fill in the 
definition of the variable.  Hint: If, in the course of working on the 
proof of your goal, you decide to make an inference from some of 
the givens, you may want to make that inference in the <EM>first</EM> gap; 
after all, the inference may turn out to play a role in the definition of 
the variable, so you may want it to be available to be used in the gap in 
which that definition must be filled in.
</P>
<P>If your given starts with several universal quantifiers in a row, then 
you can handle as many of them as you want in one step.  For each 
quantifier, you can choose to use either the &#8220;Use this value&#8221; 
box or the &#8220;Use this new variable&#8221; box.  Make your choice for 
the first quantifier, and then click the Next button.  Proof Designer will
fill in the value or variable you selected and then ask what you want to do 
for the next quantifier.  Once you have made your choice for the last 
quantifier you want to deal with, click OK.
</P>
<P>The instructions above also apply if you have a given of the form
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>,
but in this case there is 
also a shortcut you can use.  If you have a given of this 
form, and you also have a given of 
the form <span class="formula"><i>y</i>&isin;<i>A</i></span>, then you may 
select both and give the Universal Instantiation command.  No dialog box will
open, and Proof Designer will infer <span class="formula"><i>P</i>(<i>y</i>)</span>.
</P>
