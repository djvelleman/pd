<H1>Existence Command</H1>
<P>The Existence command can only be used when you 
have a goal of the form <span class="formula">&exist;<i>x</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>.
If you select a goal
of this form and give the Existence command, then a dialog box will 
open, asking you what value should be substituted for <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> to make 
<span class="formula"><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span> true.  If you know what value you want to use for 
<span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>, type it into the &#8220;Use this value&#8221; box and click OK.  Proof 
Designer will then say that you must prove <span class="formula"><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span> for this 
value of <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> in order to complete the proof.
</P>
<P>If you don't know what 
value you want to use for <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>, you can use the &#8220;Use this new 
variable, whose definition will be inserted later&#8221; box.  A default
variable may be filled in already, but you can change it if 
you want to.  You must choose a variable that is not already in use in the 
proof to stand for something else.  If you choose this option, then Proof 
Designer will insert a new gap into the proof in which you must give a 
definition of the variable you chose, and then it will say that you must 
prove that <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> is true of the object named by that variable.  Thus, 
there will now be <EM>two</EM> gaps in the proof: one for the definition 
of the new variable, and one for the proof that <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> is true for the 
value assigned to that variable.  You can work on these two gaps in either 
order.  In particular, you may find it useful to work on the proof that 
<span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> is true until you reach the point where you know what value 
should be assigned to the variable, and then go back and fill in the 
definition of the variable.  Hint: If, in the course of working on the 
proof that <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> is true, you decide to make an inference from some of 
the givens, you may want to make that inference in the <EM>first</EM> gap; 
after all, the inference may turn out to play a role in the definition of 
the variable, so you may want it to be available to be used in the gap in 
which that definition must be filled in.
</P>
<P>If your goal starts with several existential quantifiers in a row, then 
you can handle as many of them as you want in one step.  For each 
quantifier, you can choose to use either the &#8220;Use this value&#8221; 
box or the &#8220;Use this new variable&#8221; box.  Make your choice for 
the first quantifier, and then click the Next button.  Proof Designer will
fill in the value or variable you selected and then ask what you want to do 
for the next quantifier.  Once you have made your choice for the last 
quantifier you want to deal with, click OK.
</P>
<P>The instructions above also apply if you have a goal of the form
  <span class="formula">&exist;<i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>, but in this case there is 
also a shortcut you can use.  If you have a goal of this 
form, and you also have a given of 
the form <span class="formula"><i>y</i>&isin;<i>A</i></span>, then you may 
select both and give the Existence command.  No dialog box will open, and 
Proof Designer will say that you must prove <span class="formula"><i>P</i>(<i>y</i>)</span>
in order to complete the proof.
</P>
