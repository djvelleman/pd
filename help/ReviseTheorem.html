<H1>Revise Theorem Command</H1>
<P>
If you want to change the statement of the theorem you are proving, give
the Revise Theorem command.  The dialog box for entering theorems will open,
with the hypotheses and conclusion of the theorem you are proving already filled
in.  Make whatever changes you want to make (for information on how to do that,
see the <a href="NewTheorem.html">instructions for the New Theorem command</a>).
Click OK, and the revised theorem will be entered into the Proof Designer window.
</P>
<p>Note that any steps you have already done on the proof will be discarded, and you
  will start proving the revised version of the theorem with an empty proof.  So if
  you don't want to lose the steps you have already done on proving the original version of the
  theorem, use the <a href="Save.html">Save</a> command to save the proof before using
  the Revise Theorem command.
</p>
