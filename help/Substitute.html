<H1>Substitute Command</H1>
<P>If you have a given of the form <span class="formula"><i>x</i>=<i>y</i></span>,
then in any given or goal you may substitute <span class="formula"><i>y</i></span>
for <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> or <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span>
for <span class="formula"><i>y</i></span>.  To
perform such a substitution, select the given or goal in which you would
like to do the substitution and give the Substitute
command.

A dialog box will open.  The statement in which the substitution is to be
performed appears at the top of the dialog box, and initially the entire
statement is selected.  You can perform the substitution in only part of
the statement by selecting the part in which you want the substitution to
be performed.  Selecting works in the usual way, except that when you drag
the mouse across a part of the statement, what gets selected is <EM>the
smallest meaningful subexpression containing the symbols you drag
across</EM>.  For example, if you drag the mouse across the symbols
&#8220;<span class="formula"><i>x</i>&isin;</span>&#8221; in the statement
&#8220;<span class="formula"><i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i>&and;<i>y</i>&isin;<i>B</i></span>&#8221;,
what will be selected is the statement &#8220;<span class="formula"><i>x</i>&isin;<i>A</i></span>&#8221;.
</P>
<P>Click on the word &ldquo;Substitute&rdquo; in the dialog box, and a menu will
appear showing all available substitutions; an
entry of the form &#8220;<span class="formula"><i>x</i>&rArr;<i>y</i></span>&#8221;
means &#8220;replace <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> by
<span class="formula"><i>y</i></span>&#8221;.  Select a substitution from the menu
and the substitution will be performed.  If no substitutions are available, there will be no
Substitute menu in the dialog box.  The other
buttons in the dialog box can be used to rewrite the statement in some
other ways; for details see the instructions for the <A
href="Reexpress.html">Reexpress</A> command.
