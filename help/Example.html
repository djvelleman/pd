<H1>An Example of a Proof in Proof Designer</H1>
<P>Perhaps the best way to see what Proof Designer does is to work out a
simple example.  These instructions will lead you through using Proof
Designer to prove the following theorem: If <span class="formula"><i>U</i>&#x2288<i>V</i></span>
then <span class="formula">&forall;<i>X</i>(<i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i>&rarr;<i>U</i>&#x2288<i>X</i>)</span>.
</P>
<OL>
<LI><p>Choose New Theorem from the File menu in the Proof Designer window.
A dialog box will open, asking you to type in the hypotheses and conclusion
of the theorem you want to prove.  Type <span class="formula"><i>U</i>&#x2288<i>V</i></span>
(to type the &ldquo;not a subset&rdquo;
symbol, click on the <span class="formula">&#x2288</span>
button in the symbol palette at the top of the dialog box).  Click the Add Hypothesis button, and
the statement <span class="formula"><i>U</i>&#x2288<i>V</i></span> will appear in the list of
hypotheses.  Now type
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>X</i>(<i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i>&rarr;<i>U</i>&#x2288<i>X</i>)</span>
and click on the Set Conclusion button.  When you have the hypothesis and conclusion entered correctly,
click OK.
</p>
<p>
The statement of the theorem will appear in the Proof Designer window, followed by
the word &#8220;Proof:&#8221; and then a summary of what you know
(&#8220;Givens&#8221;) and what you have to prove (&#8220;Goal&#8221;) in
order to complete the proof.  This summary is set off from the rest of the
contents of the window by being indented and enclosed in a box, it has a pink background, and in the
upper left corner of the box there is a small button containing a
&#8220;?&#8221;.  (We'll see what the button does later.)  As you follow
the instructions below, an outline of the proof will gradually take shape
in this window.  &#8220;Gaps&#8221; in the proof indicating where
additional steps still need to be added will always be indicated in this
outline by summaries like this one, contained in pink boxes with a ?  button in
the upper left corner.
</p>
<blockquote>
  Note:  There are keystrokes you can use to type mathematical symbols, rather than using the buttons
  on the symbol palette.  You can find a complete list of these keystrokes <a href="Expressions.html">here</a>.

If you enter the hypothesis incorrectly, you can click on it to select it, click
the Cut Hypothesis button, and then enter the hypothesis correctly.  If you
enter the conclusion incorrectly, just enter the correct one and
click the Set Conclusion button again; the new conclusion will replace the old one.  
</blockquote>
</LI>
<LI>
<p>Since the goal starts with <span class="formula">&forall;<i>X</i></span>, the best
  way to proceed is to let <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span> stand
  for an arbitrary object.  Click on the statement
  <span class="formula">&forall;<i>X</i>(<i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i>&rarr;<i>U</i>&#x2288<i>X</i>)</span>
  under the heading &ldquo;Goal&rdquo; to select it.
  Now choose the Arbitrary Object command from the Goal menu.  A
  dialog box will appear, asking what name you would like to use for the
  arbitrary object.  The default choice <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span> will already be filled in.  Click OK.
</p>
<blockquote>
  Note:  When an instruction
  tells you to select a statement, be sure to select <i>only</i> that statement and no others.  If you accidentally
  select the wrong statement, or you select an extra statement in addition to the right one,
  you can click on the mistakenly selected statement again to deselect it.
</blockquote>
<p>
  The window containing the proof will get updated.  Proof Designer will
  create a subproof in which <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span> is introduced as an arbitrary object. 
  To finish the subproof, you must prove the statement
  <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i>&rarr;<i>U</i>&#x2288<i>X</i></span>. 
  The declaration of <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span> as an arbitrary object only applies to steps
  inside the subproof; outside the subproof, <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span> is undefined.  To
  indicate this, Proof Designer sets off the subproof from the rest of the
  proof by indenting it and enclosing it in a box.  In the upper left corner
  of the box there is a small button containing the symbol &#8220;&therefore;&#8221;.  Proof Designer also writes the final
  sentence of the proof, saying that since <span class="formula"><i>X</i></span> was arbitrary, we can
  conclude that <span class="formula">&forall;<i>X</i>(<i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i>&rarr;<i>U</i>&#x2288<i>X</i>)</span>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Note:  If you make a mistake, you can use the Undo command in the Edit Menu.
  </blockquote>
  </LI>
<LI><p>
  The goal is now an if-then statement.  We'll prove it using a direct proof.  Select the goal and choose Direct from the
  Goal menu.  Proof Designer will introduce another subproof, nested
  inside the first, in which it is assumed that
  <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i></span>, and you must
  prove that <span class="formula"><i>U</i>&#x2288<i>X</i></span>.
  This subproof justifies the conclusion that
  <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i>&rarr;<i>U</i>&#x2288<i>X</i></span>. 
  The subproof is set off from the rest of the proof to indicate that the
  assumption <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i></span>
  only applies within the subproof.
  </p>
  </LI>
<LI>
  <p>
  To proceed further, we need to work out the logical form of the goal.
  Select the goal <span class="formula"><i>U</i>&#x2288<i>X</i></span> and
  choose the Reexpress command from the
  Strategy menu.  A dialog box will appear displaying the statement you
  selected, with buttons allowing you to reexpress the statement in a number
  of ways.  Click on the Apply Definition button, and the statement will get
  reexpressed as
  <span class="formula">&not;&forall;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i>)</span>
  (applying the definition of <span class="formula">&#x2288</span>, of
  course).  This is a negative statement, and it will be easier to work with it if we
  reepxress it as a positive statement, so click on the Reexpress Negative button, and
  the statement will be reexpressed again as
  <span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>&not;(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i>)</span>.
  The subexpression <span class="formula">&not;(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i>)</span>
  will be highlighted, and this is another negative statement, so you can click the Reexpress
  Negative button again to rewrite the statement as
  <span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&and;<i>a</i>&notin;<i>X</i>)</span>.
  Click OK. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The final reexpression
  <span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&and;<i>a</i>&notin;<i>X</i>)</span>
  will be listed as a
  <EM>variant</EM> of the original goal
  <span class="formula"><i>U</i>&#x2288<i>X</i></span>.  It is equivalent to the original
  goal, so proving the statement in either form would suffice to complete the
  proof.  A variant of a given or goal is always listed below it, indented,
  with an open circle in front of it rather than a bullet.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    Note:  In the Reexpress dialog box, you can apply reexpressions to any meaningful subexpression of the statement.
    Just select the subexpression you want to reexpress by dragging your mouse over it and then click the appropriate button.
  </blockquote>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>
    Since the new variant of the goal starts with <span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i></span>,
  we will try to prove it by finding a value to plug in for <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>.
  To do this we will have to
  look more closely at the givens.  The best one to start with is
  <span class="formula"><i>U</i>&#x2288<i>V</i></span>, since it can also be reexpressed as
  a statement starting with <span class="formula">&exist;</span>, and it is always best to use
  a given that starts with
  <span class="formula">&exist;</span> immediately.  So select the given
  <span class="formula"><i>U</i>&#x2288<i>V</i></span> and imitate the procedure from the last
  step to reexpress it in the form 
  <span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&and;<i>a</i>&notin;<i>V</i>)</span>.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
  Shortcut: double-clicking on a statement is equivalent to selecting it and choosing the Reexpress command.
  </blockquote>
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <p>
      When you know something exists, you should always give it a name.  So click on the new
     given variant
    <span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&and;<i>a</i>&notin;<i>V</i>)</span>
    to select it and choose Existential Instantiation from the Infer
    menu.  A dialog box will appear, asking what name you want to give to the
    object that is asserted to exist.  It might be best to use something other than <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>,
    to avoid confusion with the other uses of the letter <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> in the proof,
    so let's use <span class="formula"><i>c</i></span>.  Enter <span class="formula"><i>c</i></span>
    in the dialog box, and then click
    the OK button.  The statement <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&and;<i>c</i>&notin;<i>V</i></span>
    will get added to the givens list.
    </p>
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <p>
    Select the new given <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&and;<i>c</i>&notin;<i>V</i></span>
    and choose Split Up from the Infer menu.  Proof Designer will split this statement into the two
    statements <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>U</i></span> and <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>V</i></span>,
    both of which will appear in the givens list.
    </p>
    <p>
    Notice that every time you do a step, a little bit gets added to the
    proof.  This might be a good time to look at what's been written so far. 
    If you click on the ?  button, the givens and goal list will be hidden, and
    you can see more clearly how the proof is shaping up.  Click on the ? 
    button again to show the givens and goal again.  Similarly, the &therefore;
    buttons hide or show the details of the
    subproofs they introduce.  Try them out!
    </p>
  </LI>
  <LI>
    <p>
      We can now say what value should be plugged in for <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> to prove
the goal.  Looking at the givens, you might see that the right choice is
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>=<i>c</i></span>.  So select the goal variant
<span class="formula">&exist;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&and;<i>a</i>&notin;<i>X</i>)</span>
and choose Existence from the Goal menu.  A dialog box will appear,
asking you what value should be plugged in for <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> to make the goal
true.  Choose the "Use this value" option (it will already be selected),
type in <span class="formula"><i>c</i></span>, and click the OK button.  The proof will get updated
to say that you now have to prove <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&and;<i>c</i>&notin;<i>X</i></span>.
</p>
<LI>
  <p>
  The goal is now a conjunction.  To prove it, select the goal
  <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>U</i>&and;<i>c</i>&notin;<i>X</i></span>
  and choose Conjunction from the Goal menu.  Proof Designer will create <EM>two</EM> gaps,
  because you have to prove two statements to complete the proof.  In the first gap, your goal is to prove
  <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>U</i></span>, and in the second, you
  must prove <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>X</i></span>.  You can
  work on the gaps in either order.
  </p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Fortunately, we already know <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>U</i></span>,
so let's deal with the first gap first.  The goal
of this gap is already among the givens, so there is nothing more to prove,
but Proof Designer does not recognize this automatically.  You must tell
Proof Designer that the goal has been achieved.  To do this, select the
given <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>U</i></span> in the first gap
and give the Finish command from the Edit menu.  The first gap will
disappear.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>
    We will have to do a few more steps to prove the goal of the other
gap, <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>X</i></span>.  Of course, it
will follow from the givens <span class="formula"><i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i></span>
and <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>V</i></span>.  Click on the given
<span class="formula"><i>X</i>&sube;<i>V</i></span> and use the Apply Definition
button in the Reexpress dialog box to write it out as
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;<i>V</i>)</span>.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>Select the new given variant
  <span class="formula">&forall;<i>a</i>(<i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;<i>V</i>)</span>
and choose the Universal
Instantiation command in the Infer menu.  This command lets you plug in
anything you want for <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span> in the statement
<span class="formula"><i>a</i>&isin;<i>X</i>&rarr;<i>a</i>&isin;<i>V</i></span>.
A dialog box will appear, asking
what you would like to substitute for <span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>.
In this case you want to substitute <span class="formula"><i>c</i></span> for
<span class="formula"><i>a</i></span>, so choose the "Use this value" option,
type in <span class="formula"><i>c</i></span>, and click the OK
button.  The new given <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>X</i>&rarr;<i>c</i>&isin;<i>V</i></span>
will appear in the givens list.
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>
    Click on the new given <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>X</i>&rarr;<i>c</i>&isin;<i>V</i></span>
to select it, and then click on the given <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>V</i></span>
to select it as well.  Choose Modus Tollens from the
Infer menu.  Proof Designer will draw the inference
<span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>X</i></span>.
<blockquote>
  Note:  When selecting two statements, you can click on them in either order.
</blockquote>
</p>
</LI>
<LI>
  <p>The proof is now complete, since the desired goal,
<span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>X</i></span>, was just inferred in
the last step.  Select the given <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>X</i></span>
and choose Finish from the Edit menu.  The last gap
in the proof will disappear, and Proof Designer will congratulate you on
finishing the proof.
  </p>
  <p>Notice that the backgrounds of the buttons
introducing subproofs change from gray to white.  Subproof buttons always
change from gray to white when their subproofs are completed.
<blockquote>
  Note:  If you want to print your proof, you can use your browser's Print command.
</blockquote>
</p>
</LI>
<li>
  <p>
    Let's try doing the end of the proof a different way.  Undo your last two steps by choosing
    first Undo Finish and then Undo Modus Tollens from the Edit menu.
    You should be back to the point where your goal was to prove
    <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>X</i></span>.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Since your goal is a negative statement, a natural way to proceed is to use proof by
    contradiction.  Select the goal <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>X</i></span> and
    choose Contradiction from the Strategy menu.  Proof Designer will create a subproof in
    which it is assumed that <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>X</i></span> and you must
    derive a contradiction.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    Select the givens <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>X</i>&rarr;<i>c</i>&isin;<i>V</i></span>
    and <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>X</i></span> and choose Modus Ponens from the
    Infer menu.  Proof Designer will infer <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>V</i></span>.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p>
    The proof is now complete, because you have two givens that contradict each other.  Select the
    givens <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&isin;<i>V</i></span> and
    <span class="formula"><i>c</i>&notin;<i>V</i></span> and choose Finish from the Edit menu.
  </p>
</li>
</OL>
<P>You should now have a pretty good idea of what Proof Designer does.
