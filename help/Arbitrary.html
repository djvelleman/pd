<H1>Arbitrary Object Command</H1>
<P>The Arbitrary Object command can only be used when you 
have a goal of the form
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>.
Use the Arbitrary 
Object command if you want to prove this goal by letting <span class="formula"><i>x</i></span> stand for 
an arbitrary object and then proving <span class="formula"><i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>.
</P>
<P>If you select a goal of the form
<span class="formula">&forall;<i>x</i>&thinsp;<i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>
and give the Arbitrary Object command, then a dialog box will 
open, asking you what variable you want to use to stand for the arbitrary 
object.  A default value may be filled in already, but you can change it if 
you want to.  You must choose a variable that is not already in use in the 
proof to stand for something else.  When you click OK, Proof Designer will
create a subproof in which you must prove that <span class="formula"><i>P</i></span> is true for an 
arbitrary object named by the variable you chose.
</P>
<P>If your goal starts with several universal quantifiers in a row, then you can 
introduce several arbitrary objects in one step.  Choose a variable to 
stand for the first arbitrary object, and then click the Next button.  
Proof Designer will fill in the variable you selected and then ask what 
name you would like to use for the next arbitrary object.  Once you have 
chosen a name for the last arbitrary object you want to introduce, click 
OK.
</P>
