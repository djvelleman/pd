    <H1>Proof Designer Help</H1>
    <P>Proof Designer is a website that writes outlines of proofs in
    elementary set theory, under the guidance of the user. It is intended
    to help students learn to write proofs.  Proof Designer uses JavaScript; if
    you have trouble getting it to work, make sure that JavaScript is enabled in
    your browser.
    </P>
    <p> The documents listed below will help you learn how Proof Designer works.

            For each strategy, this document
            also explains what command to give in Proof Designer if you want to 
            use that strategy in a proof.  For a more complete explanation of these 
            strategies, see my book

    <H2>Stand-Alone Application Version of Proof Designer</H2>
    <P>
        A version of Proof Designer as a stand-alone application is under development.  You can find it 
        <A href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/proof-designer-2/">here</A>.  The new version is being developed by
